# Summarization_transformer_model
This project focuses on summarizing dialogue-based conversations using a Transformer model. The model takes in dialogue transcripts and generates concise summaries that capture the key points of the conversation. The primary use case is for efficiently summarizing long conversational texts in applications such as customer service, meetings, or social media interactions.

Features:
Transformer Architecture: Utilizes pre-trained models (e.g., BART) from the Hugging Face Transformers library, fine-tuned for the task of dialogue summarization.
Preprocessing: Handles tokenization, sequence formatting, and data cleaning of raw dialogues.
Training Pipeline: Code for training the model on dialogue data, with support for large datasets.
Summarization Output: Provides concise and accurate summaries of multi-turn dialogues, capturing important details and eliminating redundant information.

This project showcases the application of Transformer models for NLP tasks, specifically focusing on summarizing conversational text. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
